# M09-U50-MKS-TinyBee

This repo is containing information, marlin firmware, documentation and printables for the Wincie M09 (Alfawise U20 One / U50) converted to use the MKS TinyBee V1.0 and MKS Mini12864 V3.0 lcd screen.

Main goals

1. Keep the firmware up to date with latest Marlin version and compatible configuration files.
2. Inspire others to rebuild / convert existing cheap 3D printers to gain access to more customizations and functions at low price.
